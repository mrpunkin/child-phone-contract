# A Child's Phone Contract

## The main rules

- We will always know your password and will check the browser history and messages from time to time.
- Always answer and/or return messages or phone calls from Mom and Dad.


## Using this phone

- If it rings, answer it. Be polite. Never hang up on someone you know.
- Treat it carefully and respectfully. If it breaks or is lost, you are responsible for its repair or replacement.
- No phones at times when it’s not acceptable; during mealtimes, while watching a movie or playing a game as a family, etc.
- Be in the moment, not in your phone. If you have friends over, put the phone down and spend time with them.


## This phone and our family

- Your sister is younger and not yet ready to have a phone with messaging. Don’t use your phone to tease or taunt her. Don’t boast or deliberately make her feel jealous or left out.
- The phone will go in the kitchen drawer one hour before bedtime every night and not come out until morning.
- Your phone will be unlocked and available for use between the hours of 8am and 8pm daily.
- Mom and Dad have brought you up to be interested in the world around you. You love reading, being outside and music amongst other things. Don’t replace these things with your phone. Instead, use your phone to enhance and expand your hobbies.


## This phone and other people

- Do not text, email or say anything using this phone that you wouldn't say in person.
- Do not send threatening or mean messages to others.
- Do not lend your phone to anyone.
- Promise you will tell Mom and Dad when you receive suspicious phone calls or messages from people you don't know.
- If you see anything that scares you, or makes you uncomfortable, speak to Mom and Dad. You won’t be punished for asking for help.
- Be careful about who you tell your phone number to.


## Using the web and apps

- The web is an amazing place. Use the web for things you would openly share with us. Practice safe, responsible digital behaviour.
- Your personal email address is just that: personal. Be careful about who you share it with.
- Social media can be both wonderful and awful. What you post online stays online and so you are not allowed to have a profile on any social media channel until you are old enough. Until then, you will not allow your friends to post pictures or videos of you on social channels. In return, Mom and Dad will check with you before we post anything online about you or on your behalf.

## Three strikes

- We will operate a three strikes and out policy. Any breach of this agreement will result in a warning. After three warnings, the phone will be confiscated for 48 hours.
